# Preventatives to Research

This document tracks medications that may reduce STI transmission risk. We need to find verified sources before adding them to the calculator.

## 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY — Need Sources

### 1. DoxyPEP (Doxycycline Post-Exposure Prophylaxis)

**What it is:** Taking doxycycline 200mg within 72 hours after unprotected sex to prevent bacterial STIs.

**Who takes it:** The uninfected partner, AFTER potential exposure (not daily).

**Reported effectiveness (NEEDS VERIFICATION):**
- Chlamydia: ~88% reduction
- Syphilis: ~87% reduction  
- Gonorrhea: Less effective (~50%?) due to antibiotic resistance

**CDC Status:** Guidelines issued in 2024 recommending for MSM and transgender women with recent STI history.

**Sources to find:**
- [ ] CDC DoxyPEP guidelines (2024)
- [ ] Clinical trials (DoxyPEP study, IPERGAY, others)
- [ ] Exact percentage reductions with confidence intervals

**Questions to answer:**
- Is this per-exposure or cumulative over study period?
- Does it apply to heterosexual populations?
- What's the dosing protocol exactly?

### 2. HPV Vaccine (Gardasil 9)

**What it is:** Vaccine series that prevents HPV infection.

**Who takes it:** Anyone before exposure (ideally before sexual debut, but effective later too).

**Reported effectiveness:**
- ~90%+ for targeted HPV strains (16, 18, etc.)
- Prevents most cervical cancers and genital warts

**Why we might not include it:**
- It's a vaccine, not an ongoing medication
- Works on prevention before any exposure, not risk reduction during ongoing sexual activity
- Might be out of scope for our "per-act risk calculator"

**Decision:** [ ] Include as vaccine option  [ ] Exclude from calculator

### 3. Hepatitis B Vaccine

**What it is:** Vaccine that prevents Hepatitis B.

**Similar considerations to HPV vaccine.**

## 🟡 ALREADY HAVE — May Need Updates

### HIV: PrEP (Daily Oral)
- ✅ Currently in calculator: 99% reduction
- Source: CDC
- **Status:** Good

### HIV: U=U (Viral Suppression)
- ✅ Currently in calculator: 100% reduction  
- Source: CDC
- **Status:** Good

### HIV: Injectable PrEP (Cabotegravir / Apretude)
- NOT in calculator yet
- Every 2 months injection
- ~69-90% effective (compared to oral PrEP in trials)
- **Should we add?** Maybe as alternative to daily PrEP

### HIV: Lenacapavir (Twice-yearly injection)
- NOT in calculator yet
- FDA approved June 2025
- ~96-100% effective in trials
- **Should we add?** Possibly, if we want to show newest options

### HSV-2: Valacyclovir
- ✅ Currently in calculator: 47% reduction
- Source: Corey 2004
- **Status:** Good

## 🟢 LOW PRIORITY — Experimental/Future

### Pritelivir (HSV-2)
- Helicase-primase inhibitor
- Not yet approved
- Shows ~87%+ reduction in shedding in trials
- **Status:** Wait for approval

### ABI-5366 / ABI-1179 (HSV-2)  
- Long-acting (weekly/monthly) HSV suppressives
- Phase 1b showing 94-98% shedding reduction
- Expected Phase 2 mid-2026
- **Status:** Too early to include

## Action Items

1. **DoxyPEP is the main one to add** — it's FDA-supported, has CDC guidelines, and covers chlamydia/syphilis/gonorrhea
2. Find the actual clinical trial papers for DoxyPEP
3. Verify the exact percentages and who they apply to
4. Decide on vaccines (probably exclude from calculator)
